### Chemistry
[back to main](../README.md)

Chemistry is run in a directory which contains its own inputs 

### Inputs for the Chemical Code (in detail):

#### ```reaction file```

#### ```species file```

#### ```model.out```

Generated by main model in [```prep_for_chem.py```](../models/prep_for_chem.py)
Interpolated gas density, dust density(ies), and dust temperature for every point in the new r-z slices.

#### ```1environ.inp.e1.[radiusau.0000]```

1 input file for every z at each radius
Header is 3 lines: table header, ndust? 1?, number of z points in that direction

Contains the information from model.out reformatted and with updated gas temperatures from the high-energy RT, cosmic ray rates, and computed dust fractions for every point. 

#### ```uv file```

Formatted in [```CompileUVMC.py```](./highenergy_RT/CompileUVMC.py) to return photons/cm^2/s/A

For every radius, lists the z points, and then for every wavelength lists the flux at those z points.

#### ```x-ray file```

Formatted in [```CompileXraysMC.py```](./highenergy_RT/CompileXraysMC.py) to be in photons/cm2/s/keV

#### ```ISRF file```

Interstellar radiation field, I assume.

#### ```Radionuclide Ion Rate```

#### ```2D abundance file```
