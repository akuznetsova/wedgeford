### High Energy Radiative Transfer
[back to main](../README.md)

This is a list of the radiative processes done before the chemistry. 

## UV contribution

Original Bethell code based on [Bethell and Bergin 2011](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/739/2/78/meta#apj400374s3)

Two components (from original paper)

1. fUV continuum from stellar source with scattering computed using Henyeyâ€“Greenstein phase function. (this is the main MC done in the code)
2. Lyman alpha transport (done afterwards based on template spectrum?)

## X-ray contribution

X-ray Bethell cross-sections [Bethell and Bergin 2011b](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/740/1/7/meta)

X-ray fluxes are computed similarly, with some template set of energies and x-ray opacities (**missing this file**) and output into ```.dat``` files

X-ray cross-sections are computed with fitting functions found in original table in Bethell and Bergin (given in per H nucleus)

and components are combined:

with some assumption of the "blanketing factor" and "dust settling" - both of these just scale the contribution to the cross-section from dust.
The xray-radiative transfer in the Bethell code uses these for the local MC calculations inputting an epsilon for each point in the local grid.

The ionization rates for He and H are computed based on the X-ray flux at each location. 


**Note**

In principle, both of these could be done with the ```radmc3d mcmono ``` method either by adopting simple continuum models or using template spectra for the fUV and X-ray for which radmc3d would provide mean intensity fields for the UV and X-ray at every point.

UV Henyey-Greenstein for ```radmc-3d mcmono``` should be done with ```scattering_mode=2```
X-ray ```radmc-3d mcmono``` can be done with the absorption coefficients scaled. (i.e. for some constant/average dust to gas ratio of the small dust to include the constant gas component there as well). We don't really need to do the RT with the large grains in this case as the absorption coefficients are much much smaller for larger grains and will affect the opacities a lot less. 

These opacities can be added into the ```dust_kappa...inp``` files based on the chosen model. (```mc therm``` will run fine as the wavelengths will be limited to the stellar spectrum and ISRF). 

Then the gas temperature could be recalculated just like in ```torus2chem.py``` on the original grid. 

This has the advantage that the model wouldn't be downsampled and interpolated for the high energy RT, so would be consistent with the values put into the original radmc model. (really cuts down on the amount of interpolation in general if this is computed on the original spherical grid)

The final values for the temperature could be computed on the original grid and then interpolated with everything else to the r,z slices for the chemistry.

Also has the advantage of not having to have IDL to make this work...

See Appendix in this [DIANA paper](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2016/02/aa26538-15.pdf) for some simple fUV and X-ray continuum models.

Then can use the same output writer in the compilation scripts to generate the ```.dat``` files for the chemistry.

## Cosmic ray flux 
Attenuation in a column down the midplane based on model fits from Cleeves et al 2013.

## Interstellar Radiation Field (ISRF)
Radmc-3D can take an ISRF to add to the dust temperature computation. Since the chemistry takes it as well, it makes sense to be consistent with the dust temperature calculations and use the same one for each.
